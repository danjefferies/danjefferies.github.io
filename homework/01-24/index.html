    <h3>This is one of my favorite photos I've taken in Boston!</h3>
    <p>When the weather was not yet atrocious, I would go for a walk everyday to
        the MFA to "sunbathe" in the front lawn. 
    </p>

    <p>Funny story...one time I wondered why the grassy area, usually crammed with college
        students and families alike, was empty. Where were the lawn chairs? Where was I going to sit?
    </p>

    <p> I turned around and the SPRINKLER was on. And boy was I soaked. After that,
        I decided a nice walk over to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was better suited.

    <p> One morning the leaves were nothing but yellow :) </p>
